# ml_reinforcement_learning

This repo looks into differnet forms of reinforcement learning, especially for games. The first file looks at trying to paly a chess game and is only partially finished - as of now, it identifies the pieces and corners on a chess board given a picture of a game. The second file uses reinforcement learning (Q learning) and a feed forward network to play Othello. The third file is a hand-coded file of playing Othello implementing learned techniques and artificial intelligence. 

The next files are named accordingly, with aritificial intelligence techniques for Sudoku, Crossword Puzzles, and the Slider puzzle where you try to arrange 8 blocks correctly in a 3x3 grid (i.e. game played often in Survivor).
