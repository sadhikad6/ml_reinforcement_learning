# ml_reinforcement_learning

This repo looks into differnet forms of reinforcement learning, especially for games. The first file looks at trying to paly a chess game and is only partially finished - as of now, it identifies the pieces and corners on a chess board given a picture of a game. The second file uses reinforcement learning (Q learning) and a feed forward network to play Othello. The third file is a hand-coded file of playing Othello implementing learned techniques and artificial intelligence.
